Seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in conjunction with the typical psychoanalytically-oriented treatment used in the clinic. The therapists' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy (and psychotherapy research) were clearly conveyed to the patients. Indicative of this are the following: (a) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking, although a similar percentage remained in treatment; (b) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication; (c) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking. The research team, made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists, diligently collected outcome data, but ignored its responsibility to enforce drug-relation portions of the protocol. Overall, patients remained in therapy, improved and participated in completing forms, so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted, while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual.\",\n",

Even with the major advantages of the long-acting injectable neuroleptics over oral medication, the schizophrenic patient population remains a group with a high incidence of psychiatric and social morbidity which continues to require the full resources of both the hospital and community services.',\n",

The theoretical and practical aspects of behavioral psychotherapy have changed a great deal over the past few years and continue to evolve rapidly.

It appeared that beta-adrenergic blockade had no clinically significant effect on the magnitude of hypotension or the degree of heart rate acceleration induced by the administration of the potent vasodilator diazoxide. This reflex vasodilator-induced cardio-acceleration after propranolol adminstration could be the result of incomplete blockade of endogenously released neurotransmitter, inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, or a direct pharmacologic action of diazoxide. Diazoxide administration to hypertensive patients in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was not associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic consequences.',\n",

Compared to the placebo period (190/117 mm Hg) the hypotensive effect of atenolol (-24/16 mm Hg) was more pronounced than the hypotensive effect of bendrofluazide (-17/6 mm Hg). Arguments in favor of initiating antihypertensive drug therapy with beta blocker were its more powerful hypotensive effect, the quicker onset of its action, less metabolic disturbance, decreased frequency of complaints and patient's preference. On thiazides body weight and the frequency of swollen ankles decreased. Plasma renin concentration was not found to have a strong predicting power for the hypotensive effect of atenolol or bendrofluazide but low renin patients showed a more pronounced blood pressure decrease on bendrofluazide and high renin patients, especially essential hypertensives, on atenolol. While these points can be a guide to therapy today, the preference of one drug over the other must eventually be based on their relative efficacy in decreasing morbidity and mortality from the hypertensive disease.\",\n",

The set deals with the short- and long-term effects of improving nutrition in Guatemalan villages characterized by deficient diets, high rates of infection and pronounced growth retardation in the first 3 y of life. The data reviewed come from two studies carried out over two decades: the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) longitudinal study (1966-1977) and its follow-up (1988-1989). The longitudinal study included a nutrition intervention that improved the energy and nutrient intakes of women and preschool children. Its effects included improved birthweights, reduced infant mortality rates and improved growth rates in children < 3 y of age. Growth rates from 3 to 7 y of age, similar to those of well-nourished children, were not affected by the intervention. The follow-up study was conducted when the subjects were 11-27 y old. Among the long-term effects found were greater stature and fat-free mass, particularly in females, improved work capacity in males and enhanced intellectual performance in both genders. The nutrition intervention did not, on the other hand, accelerate maturation during adolescence, as measured by skeletal age or age at menarche. It is concluded that improved nutrition in early childhood has important long-term effects in the adolescent and adult.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nIn patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD), the alternation of MOPP with ABVD or hybrid MOPP/ABVD are associated with a high CR rate and a high probability of 5-year survival. However, even after effective chemotherapy the risk of nodal relapse is not negligible, and not only in initial bulky site(s) of disease. For this reason, in an attempt to prevent relapses after combination chemotherapy alone, we performed a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy and toxic effects of 6 courses of hybrid MOPP/ABVD followed by radiotherapy (RT) in stages II A bulky, II B, III and also in stage IV with bulky disease of residual after chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nFrom January 1985 to August 1993, 133 patients with HD (128 newly diagnosed, stage II A bulky-IV, 5 in first relapse after RT) were treated according to the following program: 6 courses of the hybrid MOPP/ABVD regimen followed by RT (STNI + spleen in stages II A, II B, III without pelvic lymph node involvement, TNI + spleen in stage III with pelvic lymph node involvement, involved field in stage IV with bulky disease or residual after chemotherapy). The total dose of RT was 4000 cGy to the sites of bulky or residual disease and 2000 cGy to the other sites.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAfter hybrid MOPP/ABVD, 107 of 130 (82.3%) fully evaluable patients were classified as in CR or CR(U). After completion of RT, 108 patients were in CR and 3 were in PR, for an overall response rate of 85%. With a median follow-up duration of 45 months, the actuarial 5-year survival is 76% and the progression-free survival 68.6%. So far, only 14 patients have relapsed (6 within the irradiation field) and the 5-year relapse-free survival is 82.5%.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nSix courses of hybrid MOPP/ABVD followed by RT in stages II A bulky, II B, III and in stage IV with bulky disease or residual after chemotherapy produced a high CR rate with low risk of relapse. However, a longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate the late effects of combined therapy.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of this study was to determine whether improved compliance by intensive medication counselling, given by a pharmacist, to elderly patients with chronic stable heart failure can influence both objective and subjective measures of heart failure. Elderly patients were randomly allocated to receive a 3-month counselling programme, or no counselling. Measures recorded at the beginning and end of the study included; submaximal 6-minute exercise tests, visual analogue scores of breathlessness, the Nottingham Health Profile, and clinical signs of heart failure. Compliance was measured by a tablet count and medication knowledge assessed by means of a questionnaire. There was no significant difference between the groups in their initial level of compliance, medication knowledge or other assessments. Compliance improved for the counselled group by 32% (P < 0.001) but remained unchanged for controls. Medication knowledge improved for the counselled group only. The 6-minute exercise test improved by 20 metres from a baseline of 137 m for the counselled group (P < 0.005) but worsened by 22 m for the control group (P < 0.01). Distance to breathlessness improved for the counselled patients and worsened for controls. In contrast bodyweight, jugular venous pressure and Nottingham Health Profile scores did not change significantly for either group. Peripheral and pulmonary oedema scores improved for the counselled group (P < 0.01) but remained unchanged for controls. A small improvement was seen in the visual analogue scores (P < 0.05) for the counselled group only. Improved compliance due to intensive medication counselling had a small but measurable beneficial effect on objective measures of heart failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As part of a programme assessing the pharmacokinetics of oral thiopurines given for lymphoblastic leukaemia, we assayed intracellular metabolites of mercaptopurine in children from all over the United Kingdom who were given a standard dose of the drug. The metabolites we measured, thioguanine nucleotides and methylmercaptopurines, are products of two competing metabolic pathways and would be expected to show an inverse correlation. A total of 327 children from 17 centres in the UK were studied. All were on the same therapeutic schedule of mercaptopurine. All had been on an unattenuated full protocol-directed dose (at least 75 mg m-2) for a minimum of 7 days before assay. There was a very wide variation in the concentration of the two metabolites measured; the thioguanine nucleotides ranged from 0 to 1255 pmol per 8 x 10(8) red cells (median 289, lower quartile 210, upper quartile 377) and the methylmercaptopurine metabolites ranged from 0 to 46.3 nmol per 8 x 10(8) red cells (median 5.18, lower quartile 2.31, upper quartile 11.59). The anticipated negative correlation was not apparent, but the ratio between the two was not randomly distributed. No child had both metabolite concentrations in the upper quartiles, but in 32 (10%) children the concentration of both metabolites was in the lower quartile. Of the 32, only one metabolite was detected in four and none at all in six. The most likely explanation for these findings is that a minority of children with lymphoblastic leukaemia fail to take oral mercaptopurine either totally or intermittently. The extent of the problem is unknown, but we suspect it may be clinically important in at least 10% of patients.',\n",

Serum ECP levels reflect avoidance of the allergen, and successful treatment of asthma inflammation with corticosteroids cause a reduction of the inflammation in the lung. When individual patients with asthma are followed, the level of serum ECP can be used (1) as an early indicator of the degree of inflammation, (2) for monitoring the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy, and (3) for possible noncompliance with treatment.',\n",

Demographic and clinical data were obtained from patient interviews and computerized databases, and blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained before dialysis. Labeled names and dosages of antihypertensive drugs were recorded from containers the patients brought with them. Patients were asked to describe their adherence to the medications, their ability to afford the drugs, and their knowledge and beliefs about hypertension. Physical impairments in taking medication were also evaluated.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe frequency of hypertension was 89% in the 270 participants. Antihypertensive drugs were prescribed for 76% of the patients; 25% required three or more drugs. Hypertensive patients who were not receiving antihypertensive drugs (14%) had significantly higher BP than patients who were. Calcium-channel blockers were prescribed for 60% of patients, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors for 33%, and beta-blockers for 34%. Eighty-three percent said the cost of drugs was never a problem, and 23% said they sometimes forgot to take their medication. Almost all patients said they would not stop taking antihypertensive drugs if they were feeling better and agreed that monitoring BP was important. Twenty-two percent could not read the warning on a standard tablet container, and 12% could not remove one tablet from the container.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nMultidrug antihypertensive therapy was common among hemodialysis patients and was associated with significantly lower BP; calcium-channel blockers were the most frequently prescribed agents. Most patients said they could afford drugs and reported good adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.',\n",

Patients in the intervention arm scored higher on a hypertension knowledge quiz (7.48 +/- 1.6 vs 7.06 +/- 1.6; P=.019), and reported higher satisfaction with several aspects of their care. No significant difference was seen in the prevalence of home blood pressure monitoring ownership or use.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn patients with mildly uncontrolled hypertension, educational mailers did not yield a significant decrease in blood pressure. However, significant improvement in patient knowledge, frequency of home monitoring, and satisfaction with care were demonstrated.\",\n",

All claims data were analyzed for presence of ICD-9 codes indicating diagnosis of DM or ARMD and the performance of eye exams. The dependent variable was a binary indicator for whether a person had an eye exam or not during a 15-month period. Independent variables for demographics, living conditions, supplemental insurance, income, and other factors affecting the marginal cost and benefit of an eye exam were assessed to determine reasons for noncompliance.\\n\\n\\nDATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS\\nPanel data were created from claims files, 1991-1999, merged with data from the NLTCS.\\n\\n\\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS\\nThe probability of having an exam reflected perceived benefits, which vary by patient characteristics (e.g., education, no dementia), and factors associated with the ease of visit.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nIn the fight against the global tuberculosis epidemic, it is essential to ensure that patients adhere to the treatment prescribed. As the treatment is given for a minimum of 6 months it is common for patients not to take their drugs regularly. Strategies are therefore needed to assess adherence to treatment. One established method is to examine the patient's urine for the presence of drug metabolites. A rapid point-of-care test would overcome some of the drawbacks associated with currently available methods.\\n\\n\\nMETHOD\\nA rapid, safe point-of-care test for isoniazid metabolites (IsoScreen, Surescreen Diagnostics Limited, Derby, UK) has been developed and used to help assess adherence to treatment in a busy clinic for tuberculosis patients in South London.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nUrine samples were examined from 191 patients receiving isoniazid, usually in combination with rifampicin and other anti-tuberculous drugs. Isoscreen was positive in 93.2% of patients, suggesting that 6.8% might be poorly adhering to treatment. By contrast, examining the same urine samples for evidence of rifampicin ingestion gave positive results in only 43.5%, due to the fact that this test is only positive for a few hours after drug ingestion.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nIsoScreen has been shown to provide a rapid and safe point-of-care test, which contributes to the detection of non-adherence in patients with tuberculosis.\",\n",

Advanced provision increases use but the effect on contraceptive behaviour varies.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWomen aged 18-45 years, using less effective contraceptives, were randomized to either advanced provision of three courses of EC (intervention) or to obtaining each course from clinic (control). EC use and contraceptive behaviour were monitored for 1 year.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIn all, 1030 women were recruited in 6 months. The mean+/-SD number of courses of EC used in intervention versus control group was 0.56+/-1.2 versus 0.20+/-0.6 (P<0.001). In the intervention group, 47% women aged <26 years used at least one course of EC compared with 23% of older women (P<0.001). The majority of women used condoms before (intervention 89%, control 91%) and during the study (89% for both groups). Consistency of contraceptive use was higher during the study (65 versus 60% of women in both groups) (P<0.001). There were 17 unplanned pregnancies, eight in the intervention group, six of whom did not use EC in the conception cycle.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAdvanced provision increases EC use especially among young women in Hong Kong.

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nUncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are usually managed in primary care with antibiotics. However, many women seem to prefer to handle UTI symptoms with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other remedies. The aim of this study was to compare UTI management as recommended by physicians with the patients' management at home.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThis prospective cohort study in German primary care is based on clinical data from local practices and patient questionnaires. Participating women completed a baseline data sheet in the practice; their urine sample was tested by a dipstick in the practice and cultured by a laboratory. The women reported treatment and symptom-related impairment on an eight-item symptom questionnaire daily for 7\\u2009days. Using growth curve models, we analysed the influence of time on the total severity score to examine how symptoms changed across days. We then examined whether symptom severity and symptom course differed between patients who took antibiotics or NSAIDs.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nA total of 120 women (mean age of 43.3\\u2009±\\u200916.6\\u2009years) were enrolled. The urine dipstick was positive for leucocytes in 92%, erythrocytes in 87%, and nitrites in 23%. Physicians prescribed antibiotics for 102 (87%) women and recommended NSAIDs in 14 cases. According to the women's reports, only 60% (72/120) took antibiotics, while the remainder took NSAIDs and other remedies. Symptoms declined from day 0 to day 6, irrespective of whether women decided to take an antibiotic, NSAIDs, none or both, as confirmed by a significant curvilinear time effect (B\\xa0=\\u20090.06, SE\\xa0=\\u20090.005, p\\xa0<\\u2009.001). The symptom course, however, was moderated by taking antibiotics so that the change in symptom severity was somewhat more pronounced in women taking antibiotics (B\\xa0=\\u20090.06) than in the remainder (B\\xa0=\\u20090.04).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nA substantial proportion of women did not follow their physicians' treatment recommendations, and many used NSAIDs. All women had a good chance of recovery irrespective of whether they decided to take antibiotics. A sensitive listening to patient preferences in the consultation may encourage physicians to recommend and prescribe symptomatic treatment with NSAID more often than antibiotic medicines.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND\\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused disruptions to healthcare systems and endangered the control and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). We investigated the nationwide effects of COVID-19 on the national Public-Private Mix (PPM) TB control project in Korea, using monitoring indicators from the Korean PPM monitoring database.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nThe Korean PPM monitoring database includes data from patients registered at PPM hospitals throughout the country. Data of six monitoring indicators for active TB cases updated between July 2019 and June 2020 were collected. The data of each cohort throughout the country and in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Seoul Metropolitan Area, and Jeonnam-Jeonbuk were collated to provide nationwide data. The data were compared using the χ² test for trend to evaluate quarterly trends of each monitoring indicator at the national level and in the prespecified regions.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nTest coverages of sputum smear (P = 0.622) and culture (P = 0.815), drug susceptibility test (P = 0.750), and adherence rate to initial standard treatment (P = 0.901) at the national level were not significantly different during the study period. The rate of loss to follow-up among TB cases at the national level was not significantly different (P = 0.088); however, the treatment success rate among the smear-positive drug-susceptible pulmonary TB cohort at the national level significantly decreased, from 90.6% to 84.1% (P < 0.001). Treatment success rate in the Seoul metropolitan area also significantly decreased during the study period, from 89.4% to 84.5% (P = 0.006).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur study showed that initial TB management during the COVID-19 pandemic was properly administered under the PPM project in Korea. However, our study cannot confirm or conclude a decreased treatment success rate after the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited data.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We aimed to assess the perceived impact of the lockdown, imposed to control the spreading of COVID-19, on the adherence of Italian celiac disease (CD) subjects to the gluten-free diet by a web-based survey. A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents. Therefore, the lockdown led to a reported improved adherence to the GFD in one-third of the respondents, in particular in those with previous worse disease control, offering the opportunity to avoid sources of contamination/transgression and increase the use of naturally gluten-free products.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND\\nThe use of face masks by children for the prevention of COVID 19 is still controversial, especially with regards to who should wear the face mask and at what age.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\nThe study aimed to ascertain the perception of mothers on masking in children as a preventive strategy for COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nThis was a cross-sectional study carried out in two health institutions among 387 mothers who presented with their children for the first time in the hospital during the COVID 19 pandemic. A pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire which was designed by the researchers was used for data collection.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nMinority (44.7%) of the mothers perceived masking in children as an appropriate measure for the prevention of COVID-19. The frequent reasons given by majority (55.3%) of the mothers for the inappropriateness of face mask in children included perceived difficulty in breathing (38.5%) and the child's readiness to pull it off (29.3%). A significantly higher proportion of the children whose mothers were 35 years and above, 64.2% would wear face masks when compared with 31.7% of those whose mothers were < 30 years of age (χ2 = 28.632, p<0.001). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion (51.0%) of the children who were more than one year of age would wear a face mask when compared with 20.5% of those aged eight days to one year (χ2 = 19.441, p<0.001). The children whose mothers were <30 years were about four times less likely to wear a face mask when compared with those whose mothers were aged 35 years and above. (AOR = 0.273; 95%CI: 0.155-0.478). The children whose fathers have attained tertiary education were about twice less likely to wear face masks when compared with those whose fathers have attained secondary education and less. (AOR = 0.554; 95%CI: 0.334-0.919). Mothers' perception of COVID-19 had no significant influence on children's use of face mask (χ2 = 2.337, p = 0.127).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nMaternal perception of masking in children as an appropriate strategy for preventing COVID-19 is adjudged low in this study. Right perception is significantly enhanced by maternal educational status, employment and marital status.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, with no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccine available in the imminent future, public health responses must continue to rely on non-pharmacological interventions. We developed three innovation media to promote physical distancing compliance (i.e., a fearful picture, a red one-way arrow sign, and a norm-speech sticker). This study aimed to compare physical distancing compliance between our interventions and conventional interventions. Our study was a quasi-experiment, and we observed a representative sample of university canteen customers via closed-circuit television (CCTV). Each intervention was monitored over non-prime-time hours, per day, on 6-9 August 2020. Among the 400 participants (100 participants in each group), their age group, gender, and physical distancing practices were observed in a university canteen. The number of failures of physical distancing ranged between 93.8% and 17.6%, and on average between 84.2% and 34.2%, dependent on the intervention and the marking point. There were no statistically significant differences in promoting physical distancing compliance between our interventions compared with conventional interventions. However, the participants tended to practice physical distancing at the back of the queue more than at the front, regardless of the interventions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES\\n1. To compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance strategies in detecting COVID-19 within the homeless shelter population. 2. To assess the participant adherence over time for each surveillance method.\\n\\n\\nTRIAL DESIGN\\nThis is a prospective cluster-randomized study to compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance regimens across eight homeless shelters in the city of Hamilton.\\n\\n\\nPARTICIPANTS\\nParticipants will include both residents of, and the staff working within, the homeless shelters. All participants aged 18 or older who consent to the study and are able to collect a swab sample (where relevant) are eligible for the study. The study will take place across eight homeless shelters (four men-only and four women-only) in the City of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada.\\n\\n\\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR GROUPS\\nThe comparator group will receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing will only be completed in symptomatic participants (i.e. those who fail screening or who seek care for potential COVID-19 related symptoms). The three intervention arms will all receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing of symptomatic participants (as in the comparator group) in addition to one of the following: 1. Once weekly self-collected oral swabs (OS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 2. Once weekly self-collected oral-nares swab (O-NS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions. 3. Once weekly nurse collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) regardless of symptoms. Participants will follow verbal and written instructions for the collection of OS and O-NS specimens. For OS collection, participants are instructed to first moisten the swab on their tongue, insert the swab between the cheek and the lower gums and rotate the swab three times. This is repeated on the other side. For O-NS collection, after oral collection, the swab is inserted comfortably (about 2-3 cm) into one nostril, parallel to the floor and turned three times, then repeated in the other nostril. NPS specimens were collected by the nurse following standard of care procedure. All swabs were placed into a viral inactivation medium and transported to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens and then amplified by RT-PCR for the UTR and Envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human RNase P gene, which is used as a sample adequacy marker.\\n\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES\\n1.\\n\\n\\nPRIMARY OUTCOME\\nCOVID-19 detection rate, i.e. the number of new positive cases over the study period of 8 weeks in each arm of the study. 2.\\n\\n\\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES\\nQualitative assessment of study enrollment over 8 weeks. Percentage of participants who performed 50% or more of the weekly swabs in the intervention arms in the 8 week study period.\\n\\n\\nRANDOMIZATION\\nWe will use a computer-generated random assignment list to randomize the shelters to one of four interventions. Shelters were stratified by gender, and the simple randomization scheme was applied within each stratum. The randomization scheme was created using WinPEPI.\\n\\n\\nBLINDING\\nThis is an open-label study in which neither participants nor assessors are blinded.\\n\\n\\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE)\\nSince we are including our total sample frame, a sample size estimation at the cluster level is not required. However, if we succeed to enroll 50 participants per shelter from 8 shelters (n=400), and the detection rate is 3 times higher in the intervention groups (0.15) than in the comparator groups (0.05), we will have 90% power to detect a statistically significant and clinically important difference at a type I error rate of alpha=0.05 (one tailed), assuming an intraclass correlation of ~0.008. These computations were done using WinPEPI, and informed by conservative estimates from other studies on respiratory illness in the homeless (see Full protocol).\\n\\n\\nTRIAL STATUS\\nThe protocol version number is 3.0. Recruitment began on April 17, 2020 and is ongoing. Due to low numbers of COVID cases in the community and shelter system during the initial study period, the trial was extended. The estimated date for the end of the extended recruitment period is Feb 1, 2021.\\n\\n\\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\\nThe trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on June 18, 2020 with the identifier NCT04438070 .\\n\\n\\nFULL PROTOCOL\\nThe full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aim To study long-term compliance with treatment in patients included into the REGistry of pATients after myocArdial infarction (REGATA).Material and methods In 2012-2013, the study included 481 patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) who visited the district outpatient clinic. Median age was 72 [62;78] years; men, 51.4\\u200a% (n=247); median time from the last MI to the date of inclusion into the registry was 5 [2;9] years. Compliance with treatment was determined with the Morisky-Green questionnaire during telephone contacts with patients at 36 and 48 months (n=230) after the inclusion. Patients scored 4 were considered compliant; patients scored 3 were low-compliant; and patients scored 0-2 were non-compliant. Statistical significance of differences in compliance at 36 and 48 months was assessed with the McNemar test.Results There were no significant differences between the proportions of compliant, low-compliant and non-compliant patients for the analyzed period. However, at 48 months after the inclusion, the number of patients who had difficulties in answering the questionnaire questions significantly increased from 15.5\\u200a% to 21.6\\u200a% (p=0.04). Analysis of changes in compliance with the treatment for only compliant patients showed that at 36 months from the inclusion, 87 patients remained highly compliant (37.8\\u200a%) while at 48 months, only 32 (36.8\\u200a%) patients remained compliant with the treatment. Proportion of compliant patients did not significantly differ for men and women, patients younger and older than 60 years, patients with primary MI and reinfarction, prone and not prone to self-management, and for those who used or not the medicine assistance.Conclusion The data obtained as a part of the REGATA registry indicate insufficient long-term compliance with the treatment of after-MI patients with both primary MI and reinfarction, an increasing proportion of patients who are unable to assess their degree of compliance, and decreasing compliance among highly compliant patients during the period between 36 and 48 months of observation. On the whole, there were no significant changes in the compliance with the treatment for 12 months between the first and the second interviews. The proportion of patients compliant with the prescribed drug therapy was significantly lower in the presence of predisposition to self-management.',\n",

Seventy-seven consecutive patients were given one of two anti-anxiety drugs or a placebo in conjunction with the typical psychoanalytically-oriented treatment used in the clinic. The therapists' attitudes favouring psychotherapy over drug therapy (and psychotherapy research) were clearly conveyed to the patients. Indicative of this are the following: (a) 82 per cent of the patients dropped out of drug taking, although a similar percentage remained in treatment; (b) only a third of the patients perceived it as being important to their therapists that they should take medication; (c) 87 per cent of the patients were rated as improved; and 75 per cent of patients completing forms considered that most or all of their improvement was attributable to talking. The research team, made up of members of the same department who therefore had similar values as the therapists, diligently collected outcome data, but ignored its responsibility to enforce drug-relation portions of the protocol. Overall, patients remained in therapy, improved and participated in completing forms, so that only the research goals of combined therapy were thwarted, while traditional clinic service and training goals proceeded as usual.\",\n",

Even with the major advantages of the long-acting injectable neuroleptics over oral medication, the schizophrenic patient population remains a group with a high incidence of psychiatric and social morbidity which continues to require the full resources of both the hospital and community services.',\n",

Although hardly a panacea for all ills, the behavioral approach is the treatment of choice for certain selected problems. Behavioral methods make their contribution in the context of general psychiatric management and often must be used in conjunction with other treatment. The theoretical and practical aspects of behavioral psychotherapy have changed a great deal over the past few years and continue to evolve rapidly. Although useful molecular theories are emerging to guide the discipline, no global theory is likely to be satisfactory in the foreseeable future.',\n",

It appeared that beta-adrenergic blockade had no clinically significant effect on the magnitude of hypotension or the degree of heart rate acceleration induced by the administration of the potent vasodilator diazoxide. This reflex vasodilator-induced cardio-acceleration after propranolol adminstration could be the result of incomplete blockade of endogenously released neurotransmitter, inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system, or a direct pharmacologic action of diazoxide. Diazoxide administration to hypertensive patients in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was not associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic consequences.',\n",

Compared to the placebo period (190/117 mm Hg) the hypotensive effect of atenolol (-24/16 mm Hg) was more pronounced than the hypotensive effect of bendrofluazide (-17/6 mm Hg). Arguments in favor of initiating antihypertensive drug therapy with beta blocker were its more powerful hypotensive effect, the quicker onset of its action, less metabolic disturbance, decreased frequency of complaints and patient's preference. On thiazides body weight and the frequency of swollen ankles decreased. Plasma renin concentration was not found to have a strong predicting power for the hypotensive effect of atenolol or bendrofluazide but low renin patients showed a more pronounced blood pressure decrease on bendrofluazide and high renin patients, especially essential hypertensives, on atenolol. While these points can be a guide to therapy today, the preference of one drug over the other must eventually be based on their relative efficacy in decreasing morbidity and mortality from the hypertensive disease.\",\n",
